        <h1>Hello, and welcome to my About Me page!</h1>
    </header>
  <p>My name is Kaitlin and I am currently attending Code Fellows 
  to achieve my dream and become a coder. This was not always 
  my plan. I have a Bachelor's in Biology and was working for 
  a biopharmaceutical company. As much as I loved that job, 
  it was not for me. It took some time, but I finally have 
  enough confidence to make this career change.</p>
